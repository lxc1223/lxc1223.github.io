## More Info. about Webpage Template

[bootstrap-template](https://github.com/thecdil/bootstrap-template) is a basic template repository to create a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) site using Jekyll on GitHub Pages (or where every you want to host it).

1. create repository from the template
2. edit _config.yml
3. edit content pages
4. use customization options
